    Permutation(nperm::Int=1000)

A permutation-type fsea as described in
[Mootha et. al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1180).
First, the [`enrichment_score`](@ref) (E.S.) is calculated
for the true feature set.
Second, the random indices of the same length
as the feature set are selected and the E.S.
is recalculated `nperm` times.

The pseudo-pvalue is the fraction of permutations
where the absolute value of the E.S.
was greater than that of the true feature set.

"""
    MWU()

Uses the Mann-Whitney U-test,
which tests the hypothesis that
a random value pulled from the feature set
will be consistently less than or consistently greater than
a random value pulled from the out-of-set values,
against the null hypothesis that feature set values
are equally likely to be less than or greater than
those not in the feature set.

    fsea(model::FSEAModel, vals, fset_idx)

Perform a feature set enrichment analysis (FSEA)
on `vals`, where the feature set being tested
has indices `fset_idx`.

There are currently two types of tests that can be performed:

1. [`Permutation`](@ref) which uses the procedure originally published
   in [Mootha et. al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1180)
2. [`MWU`](@ref) (the default) which uses the non-parametric
   Mann-Whitney U-test.
